i'm not sure you can do it, but if you can, please do the this 

1. here logo, it's a bit corrupt at top can you complete two 3d '2'
2. remove background, so output is png with transparent background  
3. keep one image size as iz, 2nd height 60px 

just i have no installed photoshop on my linux, and installation via wine will take a lot of time
